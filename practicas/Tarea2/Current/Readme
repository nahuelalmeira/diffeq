This directory contains the code for solving a plane wave solution to Maxwell equations.
The integration region is [0,1]
The refraction index depends on time as well as space but the time dependence (Omega) is
of a much lower frequency than the carrier frequency (omega).

a(x,t) = 1 + lambda * bump(x) * cos(2 * \pi * Omega * t)

The function bump(x) is defined in the inidat.c file, together with the initial data
for the wave, which is taken to banish.

The wave enters from the right and can scape on the left.
The media is only varying in the region [0.25,0.75].

The equations are: (a = 1/n)

u_t = - a * u_x + (a_x + a_t/a)(u+v)/2

v_t = + a * v_x + (-a_x + a_t/a)(u+v)/2

the initial data is 0
the boundary condition to the left (x=0) is u(0,t) = sin(2 * \pi* omega * t)




Identification of which component of the vector of variables is given
in first_macro.h. There you also specify several things, like the number
of grid points, etc.

Other parameters and initial boundary conditions are given in the file "data"


To run it do:

First create a subdirectory Current and install all files there, then create
there a subdirectory Dump 

then 

make 

and then 

w2.exec

The output is managed in the file adisco.c 

The initial data is in inidat.c
The wave equations in wave_eq_1d.c
The main in wave_1d_main.c
The i/o functions in adisco.c
The derivatives are computed using the Q matrix as in Kreiss. This is
implemented in deriv_1d.c. (for different Q's see the definition
of DERIV first_macro.h)
